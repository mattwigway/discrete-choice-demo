# Discrete choice demo

This is a demonstration of fitting a multinomial logit model using [Apollo](http://www.apollochoicemodelling.com/), an open-source R package for discrete choice modeling. Data comes from [the Biogeme example datasets, specifically Swiss mode choice](http://biogeme.epfl.ch/data.html).
